#Prerequisites
node.js v0.12.7 and npm@2.14.0 are recommended

#Project Setup
To install the project dependencies run the following

npm install
```


#Get Started
Dig in and modify the app under the basic directory

To use the app template modify the player/index.html to include any configuration your app requires.

If you would like to use the fully static app modify the static/main.js

Be sure to set your device UUID and secret or your username and password (see the exp.runtime.start() portion of the JavaScript SDK README https://github.com/ScalaInc/exp-js-sdk/blob/develop/README.md)

When you are ready to try out the app, change directory to the project root and run
```
node index.js
```

To use the example app template open Chrome and visit http://localhost:3000/index.html

To use the fully static app open Chrome and visit http://localhost:3000/static/index.html
